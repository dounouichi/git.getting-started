# git.getting-started
training repository for basic GitHub functionality 

## Introduction
Throughout the course, we will use Git - an industry standard version control software - for managing the lab. You need to understand the basics usage of Git for successfully carrying out the lab.

## Tasks
1. Fork this repository
2. Clone the forked repository to your computer or the development server.
3. Create a test commit (add a new file or modify a file before).
4. Create an issue for your repository on GitHub.
5. Create a new branch named "development" and commit into this branch.
6. Merge two branches with conflicting contents.
7. Synchronize your local changes with your repository on GitHub.
8. Create a pull request to this master repository on GitHub.


## Additional Knowledge, Theory
1. Understand the concept of branches and how they can be used in projects.
2. Learn about distributed workflows for collaboration in projects.
  - Centralized workflows
  - Decentralized workflows

Note:
There are Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) supporting Git for all platforms maing the first steps a bit easier.
Here is a list of GUI clients for different operating systems:
